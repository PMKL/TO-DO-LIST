				My name is Luis A. Castellanos, I am a Computer Science Major studying at the University of St Thomas. I enjoy being involved in clubs ranging from Table Top Gaming to Boxing in the Purple Gloves club. Whenever I have free time away from my computer, I jump onto another electronic device and play game, watch films, or picking up eBooks/Audiobooks via Amazon.

				The following website was created for my CISC 375: Web Development class! This project designed to test the students ability to create a website that incorperates HTML, CSS, and Javascript coding. From a simple To-Do list webpage to a Photo gallery display, every single tool is used to form the product you have on your browser!

				HTML, CSS, and JavaScript?

				These languages are tools for developing websites! HTML offers the basics of editing a page looks. One can add tables, lists, insert images, and change colors for different sections of a webpage.
				The creative choices with HTML are lacking, which is why CSS comes into play!

			<p class="small">
				CSS allows the manipulation of HTML elements ranging from spacing, coloring, font changes. This easily demonstrated in To-Do-List section, where certain List elements appear in different colors or certain buttons such as "Add" and "X" close bytton change color when hover upon!
			</p>
			<p class="small">
				But both HTML and CSS are lacking true programming potential! Variables and conditionals that can make a website look alive, versus a simple piece of paper.
			</p>
			<p class="small">
				JavaScript, JS, is introduced in this project both in the To-Do-List and the image Gallery.
				In order to allow a user to input data into the web page, or to allow interactions within the gallery and view it in a light-box style slide show, JavaScript handles the computations.
				From listening to clicks on certain buttons, or organizing the slide show structure with variables, JS is the third tool that can either be integreated within the HTML code, or easily written on another file and called in.
